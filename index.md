Welcome to Arch Linux on i586!
------------------------------
This project aims to bring the goodness of [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) to the i586 platform. Currently we aim to provide a fairly up-to-date [core] and [extra] repo, [community] packages are built by demand.
We would really appreciate you feedback and help. The repo is currently kept at [github.com](http://github.com/jensp/Arch-Linux-on-i586). If you would like to help out, come and join us on [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/#archlinux-i586).
